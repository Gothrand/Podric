# Podric
A discord bot for posting Risk of Rain 2 Pod Seeds.  Developed by Gothrand and Wig from the Risk of Rain 2 speedrunning community.

## Goal
Find the most optimal Risk of Rain 2 seed (for patch version 1.0.0.6).

## Design details
Podric operates solely on the Risk of Rain Dedicated Speedrun Discord posting embeds of various stage 1 seeds in Risk of Rain 2.  This bot code is the 'front end' of the bot which interfaces with a heavily modified version of Risk of Rain 2's original assembly to capture images and seed information.  The goal of the bot is to find and post stage 1 seeds which are optimal for speedrunning.

## Bot commands
Podric only has commands that are only able to be used by administrators.  This may change in the future depending on community input.

## Status
Podric is currently not in operation as the goal for the project has been completed with a sub 7 minute speedrun being completed by Wig.
